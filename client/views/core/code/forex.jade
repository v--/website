    My goal is to create a practical comparison of different financial market models - various discrete models, Blackâ€“Scholes model, experimental models - by applying them to FOREX data from the [ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/). This information will be available through a public JSON API [__(/api/forex/predict)__](/api/forex/predict), part of which has already been implemented.

    In addition, I will provide here charts for visual comparison of the different models.
