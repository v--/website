      "",
      "This is a variation of the classic game [Breakout]($breakoutUrl) where the bricks evolve and form clusters, making the game nearly impossible to win unless the few starting bricks are cleared immediately.",
      "",
      "Developed in 2016 while examining React.js, and later reimplemented for my own [component system](${githubRenderingSystemUrl}).",
      "",
      "The code can be found [on GitHub](${githubPageUrl}).",

      "## Evolution",
      "",
      "The brick evolution is simple.",
      "Every brick can have ${brickMaxPower} \"power\" states, which are reduced by ball hits.",
      "There are ${startingBrickCount} starting bricks, each of the lowest power.",
      "Every ${evolutionFrequency} seconds, a random brick is chosen uniformly.",
      "After that, a neighbor (possibly the brick itself) is chosen uniformly, and it is bumped to a higher power.",
      "If the position is empty, a new brick appears.",
      "If the neighbor is of the highest power level already, the process is restarted.",
      "",
      "Additionally, there are restrictions to keep bricks from spawning too close to the paddle or to the moving ball.",
      "",
      "## Reflection",
      "",
      "Another important distinguishing feature is the elliptical paddle.",
      "It allows great control over reflection, but is also difficult to master.",
      "",
      "Reflection can be visualized using the debug mode mentioned above.",
      "The process is as follows.",
      "Several rays are emitted from distinct points on the ball, and are intersected with the stage sides, the bricks and the paddle.",
      "Once the intersection closest to the ball is calculated, we check whether the ball is close enough to pass through it on the next frame.",
      "If it is, the tangent line at that point is calculated and the ray determining this intersection is reflected off the tangent.",
      "",
      "Note that, in the visualization, we can see reflections of ray emitted from the ball's surface, but it is the ball center that will be reflected.",
      "Thus, the reflected rays only determine the direction, but not the entire ball reflection."
