# Welcome

This is a simple personal website - nothing more and nothing less.

## About me

My name is Ianis Vasilev (pronounce it however you want).
For some reason, I am studying statistics at Sofia University.
Otherwise I am a relatively sane person.

I am a programmer with a relatively creative mindset and a saxophonist with an odd style.

## About the website

This website contains random stuff that otherwise would be uploaded to other websites.
You can move around but there is not much to see.

That's basically all you need to know.
